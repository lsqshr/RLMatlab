# RLMatlab

A Matlab implementation of Neura Network based Reinforcement learning. The architecture is following RL.js (http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/reinforcejs/)

An example usage with the game PuckWorld is included as well.

A simple vanilla (supports multilayer BP) neural network class is implemented which can be easily replaced with different learning algorithms.

Simply `run.m` in Matlab to start the demo
